The sphero bolt has three sensors, it has a light, sound and crash sensor. My favorite sensor is the light sensor since its one of the easiest thing to do. the light sensor works so when you dhine the light on it, the bolt changes direction and rolls away.

For coding following instructions is extremely important. Since coding usesd a lot of words and codes if you mess up even one digit you can mess up completely ur whole code. If you commit a small error it can completly change up the whole code and project you would be working on.

One of the dailys activities i do where computer science is involved is when i do assignments in my computer. I normally dont really play minevraft but playing minecraft does require a bit of coding from time to time and thats an example of computer science aswell.

Codin can improve problem solving skills by making someone realize their little mistakes do matter and make them pay more attention to details they may not think are important enough. Coding can help in fields that dont require technology by making diagnostics easier to read or in general just helping people communicate more easily. Coding will always be about creativity because it enhances it more. To make certain codes you need to be creative enough to actually make them work out.

AI improves efficency and innovates industries by helping people comprehend complicated topics more easily more easily. AI is helpful to humans since it helps us understand things more in depth and can help humans in work spaces more efficently by acting like a tool for supoort and reasearch. Ai is controlled by humans so it is not going top be like sci-fi movies and is purely based offf the desicions of humans.
While there are advanteges to AI there is also many disadvantages. One if the most concerning disadvantages is that if the wrong people use it the AI is going to produce somethimg bad and will not only be bad but illegal. If AI is used for artistic purposes it will take away parts of real humans arts and it cant be stopped. AI also puts millions of jobs in danger, people who are writters will lose their job because AI will be used to replace them, therefore leaving people without food or money or a house. there are so many more disadvantages to AI than advanteges.

Technology does affect the elections in the way that it makes the candidates for presidents campaigns spread faster and more accurately. Social media is a great way for presidential candidates to push their image out there faster. Some negative effects however can be that older people who dont use social media as much wont see these videos so they cant be so intact of who they are going to vote for. Kamala Harris campaig is an exact example of how technology helps  presidential campaigns, she caters towards the youth and her social media campaign actually provide proof behind her statements and shows the public a clear view of what she is going to do for the USA.

When publishing online you meed to make sure you dont give out too much personal information because it could affect your day to day life. To ensure that certain information stay secure you need to make sure you arent sharing too much information of yourself or to only share it to a certain group of trusted people. While the internet is a fun place it also is very dangerous and many people have been harrased in real life, this is why people need to be morre careful with the information they share online.

Right now the current even everyone is talking about is the elections. These elections show how advertising is really important especially if you do it through social media or technolgy. social media is the best way to spread news or endorsments which is exactly why a lot of people did vote for the right decision instead of the wrong one. However technology is also a great way to make false news go around which is exactly why many people voted red. While technology keeps on advancing hopefully lies wont spread so quickly and people wont belive them so easily either.

Technology has made food more accesible by making food be delivered to people with dissabilities or that simply dont have the time to get their groceries. Technology does offer a lot about advantages because it also influences people to try food out of their comfort food. Online shopping is also something that is extremly useful and important to socirty in the us after covid 19. While there are many positives of technology being used for getting fodd there are still many problems with it because people can and will eat youtr food before you.

While AI is not my favorite thing it is something that keeps on developing the more that people keep using it. One of the developments of AI is the ability of generating images. I have been told to play around with AI by my teacher evcen though i dont like usimg it all that much and the images that it is posssible of creating are a development compared to before. The thing that concerns me about this however is how easy it is for someone to use ai for the wrong reasons. There have alredy been a lot of incidents with AI and peope making it generate thingd that arent appropiate. If this technology keeps evolviong like this there needs to be laws against some of the uses for it so it doesnt hurt anyone. While AI keeps evolving there has to be things to prevent it from getting out of hand and be used for things that actualy do matter.

The meaning of brain rot to me is a series of words or phrases that have gotten popularizee by teenagers and young adults. In the past years technology has been advancing and so has its users, teenagers grab slang and transform it into domething with a different meanin and that is what most brain rot phrases are. While some peopel may wanna look deeper into these brain rot words there isnt much more to look into their just words that teenagers say as a joke and really have no deeper meaning than that. Ex: "skibidi toilet got into a fight with livvy dunne and baby gronk joined in but the rizzler showed up and blew thwm away with his balkan sigma rage german stare"
