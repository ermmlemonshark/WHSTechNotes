Coding can help in fields that dont require technology by making diagnostics easier to read or in general just helping people communicate more easily. Coding will always be about creativity because it enhances it more. To make certain codes you need to be creative enough to actually make them work out.

AI improves efficency and innovates industries by helping people comprehend complicated topics more easily more easily. AI is helpful to humans since it helps us understand things more in depth and can help humans in work spaces more efficently by acting like a tool for supoort and reasearch. Ai is controlled by humans so it is not going top be like sci-fi movies and is purely based offf the desicions of humans.
While there are advanteges to AI there is also many disadvantages. One if the most concerning disadvantages is that if the wrong people use it the AI is going to produce somethimg bad and will not only be bad but illegal. If AI is used for artistic purposes it will take away parts of real humans arts and it cant be stopped. AI also puts millions of jobs in danger, people who are writters will lose their job because AI will be used to replace them, therefore leaving people without food or money or a house. there are so many more disadvantages to AI than advanteges.

Social media is a great way for presidential candidates to push their image out there faster. Some negative effects however can be that older people who dont use social media as much wont see these videos so they cant be so intact of who they are going to vote for. Kamala Harris campaig is an exact example of how technology helps  presidential campaigns, she caters towards the youth and her social media campaign actually provide proof behind her statements and shows the public a clear view of what she is going to do for the USA.
