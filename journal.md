The sphero bolt has three sensors, it has a light, sound and crash sensor. My favorite sensor is the light sensor since its one of the easiest thing to do. the light sensor works so when you dhine the light on it, the bolt changes direction and rolls away.

For coding following instructions is extremely important. Since coding usesd a lot of words and codes if you mess up even one digit you can mess up completely ur whole code. If you commit a small error it can completly change up the whole code and project you would be working on.

Codin can improve problem solving skills by making someone realize their little mistakes do matter and make them pay more attention to details they may not think are important enough. Coding can help in fields that dont require technology by making diagnostics easier to read or in general just helping people communicate more easily. Coding will always be about creativity because it enhances it more. To make certain codes you need to be creative enough to actually make them work out.
